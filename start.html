        <h2>How You Can Start 3D Printing</h2>
          <p>Nowadays, you don’t need to own a printer to create things. You can use online services such as <strong>Shapeways</strong> or <strong>3D Hubs</strong> to upload a file to print and have delivered at home. This might be a good option for starters, or for those who want to casually make things every now and then.</p>
          <p>Or, if you believe it’s worth it, you could choose to get a printer. In this case, you should spend lots of time researching companies that sell printers fitting your criteria (price, quality, specs, etc). But first, be warned: the hobby of 3D printing is not for the faint of heart! Things go wrong all the time, and getting the hang of it will require many hours of patience, frustration, and persistence. If you’re willing to accept that, then you’re ready to begin!</p>
          <p>Some things to know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Quick searches on Google or YouTube will usually help you answer any printing-related questions</li>
                <li>Most decent printers cost around $500-$1000, though the price typically increases with <strong>print volume</strong> (the maximum size object the printer can print)</li>
                <li>Typical print volumes range from around 4in<sup>3</sup> to 10in<sup>3</sup></li>
                <li>A kilogram of ABS or PLA plastic costs about <strong>$20</strong></li>
                <li>A kilogram is enough to print many, many things, and will last a while</li>
            </ul>
